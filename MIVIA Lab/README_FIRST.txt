MIVIA HEp-2 images datasetVersion: 1.0Release date: November 29th, 2012PREAMBLEThe MIVIA HEp-2 images dataset is an outcome of the research project “Classification of Immunofluorescence Images for the Diagnosis of Autoimmune Diseases”, supported by “Regione Campania, Italy”. The dataset can be accessed free of charge for non-commercial uses under the terms of a End User License Agreement (EULA). These terms do NOT allow the redistribution of the dataset, in any form, to parties which have not signed the EULA. For more information and for obtaining the EULA please refer to the dataset web page: http://mivia.unisa.it/datasets/biomedical-image-datasets/hep2-image-dataset/IMAGES ACQUISITIONThe dataset consists of images obtained from slides of HEp-2 substrate at the fixed dilution of 1:80, as recommended by the guidelines.The images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope (40-fold magnification) coupled with a 50W mercury vapor lamp and with a digital camera. The camera has a CCD with squared pixel of equal side to 6.45 µm. The images have a resolution of 1388×1038 pixels, a color depth of 24 bits and they are stored as bitmap images. IMAGES ANNOTATIONSpecialists manually segmented and annotated each cell, reporting data on fluorescence intensity, staining pattern and mitosis phase. In particular, for each object (segmented region) in the images the following information is provided:- staining pattern and intensity of the whole image;- coordinates of the object's seed point;- object class: cell, mitotic cell, artifact (due to the slide preparation process);- object pattern; if the object is:   - a cell, the patterns are: homogeneous, fine speckled, coarse speckled, nucleolar, cytoplasmatic and centromere;   - a mitotic cell, the patterns are: positive and negative   - an artifact, the pattern field is empty.In this database, all images contain cells belonging to the same pattern, which coincides with the pattern of the whole image.COMPOSITION OF THE DATABASEThe database contains 28 images as described in the following table.ID	Pattern		Intensity	Objects	Cells	Mitotic cells1	Homogeneous	positive	64	61	32	Fine Speckled	intermediate	52	48	33	Centromere	positive	93	89	44	Nucleolar	intermediate	73	66	35	Homogeneous	intermediate	52	47	26	Coarse Speckled	positive	77	68	17	Centromere	intermediate	62	56	38	Nucleolar	positive	60	56	19	Fine Speckled	positive	52	46	210	Coarse Speckled	intermediate	36	33	311	Coarse Speckled	intermediate	49	41	712	Coarse Speckled	positive	57	49	213	Centromere	positive	52	46	414	Centromere	intermediate	67	63	215	Fine Speckled	intermediate	68	63	516	Centromere	positive	44	38	517	Coarse Speckled	positive	20	19	118	Homogeneous	positive	43	42	119	Centromere	intermediate	70	65	320	Nucleolar	intermediate	49	46	021	Homogeneous	intermediate	66	61	422	Homogeneous	positive	120	119	123	Fine Speckled	positive	53	51	124	Nucleolar	positive	75	73	125	Cytoplasmatic	intermediate	24	24	026	Cytoplasmatic	positive	47	36	627	Cytoplasmatic	intermediate	44	38	228	Cytoplasmatic	intermediate	13	13	0CONTENT OF THE ARCHIVE\ README_FIRST.txt - this file\ Main_Dataset - root folder containing all the dataset\ Main_Dataset \ Images - folder containing all the images of the dataset\ Main_Dataset \ Images \ 01 - folder containing all data pertaining to image 01\ Main_Dataset \ Images \ 01 \ 01_mask.png - image binary mask: white pixels refer to object pixels (i.e. pixels belonging to cells or mitosis or artifacts) in the HEp-2 image 01, while black pixels refer to the background \ Main_Dataset \ Images \ 01 \ 01.csv - detailed informazioni about the objects in image 01; in particular, for each object (cell, mitotic cell, artefact) are reported information about the intensity, the cell ID, the x and y coordinates of the seed point, the object type, the pattern and the coordinates of the bounding box of the cell;\ Main_Dataset \ Images \ 01 \ 01.png - HEp-2 image 01\ Main_Dataset \ Images \ 01 \ 01.xcf - GIMP file with the mask of each object stored in a separated channel. The channel is named by the object ID reported in the 01.csv file;		... the above files are repeated for each image ...\ Main_Dataset \ Images \ 28\ Main_Dataset \ Cells - folder containing all the bounding boxes of the cells and of the associated masks for each image of the dataset\ ICPR2012_Cells_Classification_Contest - root folder containing images extracted from the dataset and used for the 1st edition of the ICPR2012 cells classification contest (http://nerone.diiie.unisa.it/hep2contest/index.shtml); it contains all and only the cells (i.e. neither artifacts nor mitotic cells) of the MIVIA HEp-2 images database. The training set contains cells from 14 images; the test set contains the cells from the remaining 14 images of the dataset. The cells extracted from the images were reassigned a new unique ID when inserted in the training or in the test set.\ ICPR2012_Cells_Classification_Contest \ test - folder containing the test data used within the contest; \ ICPR2012_Cells_Classification_Contest \ test \ 001_mask.png - image binary mask related to the bounding box of the cell 001 of the test set\ ICPR2012_Cells_Classification_Contest \ test \ 001.png - bounding box of the cell 001 of the test set		... the above files are repeated for each cell in the test set ...\ ICPR2012_Cells_Classification_Contest \ test \ gt_test.csv - ground truth of the test set\ ICPR2012_Cells_Classification_Contest \ test \ test.csv - list of the cells in the test set with some additional information about fluorescence intensity and size of the bounding box\ ICPR2012_Cells_Classification_Contest \ training - folder containing the training data used within the contest; the structure is equal to the test folder		...\ ICPR2012_Cells_Classification_Contest \ cells.csv - file reporting the associations between the cell IDs used for the contest (which were randomly permuted to avoid giving context information to the classifier) and the corresponding IDs in the Main Dataset.NOTE: The participants to the contest received only the files within the training folder.
